                English is the second most spoken language in Bangladesh, after Bengali, the country's official language. English is used in a variety of ways in Bangladesh, including:

                Media: There are ten English-language newspapers in Bangladesh.

                Literature: There is Bangladeshi English literature. 
                Accent: Bangladeshi English is an accent that is influenced by the Bengali language and its dialects. 
                Code-mixing: A mixture of Bengali and English is called Benglish. In 2012, the High Court of Bangladesh banned the use of Benglish in radio and television programs. 
                English is still widely spoken and understood in Bangladesh because of the country's history of British colonization. However, the use of English in government has decreased since the Bengali Language Implementation Act of 1987. </div>
